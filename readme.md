# Project Overview

This repository contains resources for evaluating programming solutions in Python and R across various scenarios. It was created in response to the **Call for Papers** for the 2nd Unofficial and Internal Master Student Conference (UIMSC 2024) within the course of "Scientific Writing" at Aalen University of Applied Sciences

- The **`Code examples`** folder contains working and buggy code used for Scenario 2 and Scenario 4.
- The **`Results`** folder includes subfolders for each programming language, scenario, and problem, with associated outputs and evaluation data.
- The root directory contains the **`Problems_Scenarios_EvaluationCriteria.xlsx`** file, which provides an overview of prompts, evaluation criteria, and key project aspects.
